Picasso’s Paragon: This is a paint app that also can be played as an individual/group game. The app has features of a typical paint app such as various types of brushes, an eraser, rotating, scaling up, scaling down, and saving. The user can also draw on three separate layers and save work individually. There are also unique features such as showing progress as a gallery of the images in each layer as well as a feature to merge all three layers together. Finally, there’s an “enhance” feature as a little pizzazz! This app can also be played as a game as an individual/team has to select a random word and draw something in each layer given 30 seconds for each layer.
